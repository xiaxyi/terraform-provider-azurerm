* `resource_id` - (Required) The ID of the Resource (or Resource Scope) where this should be applied. Changing this forces a new Resource Policy Assignment to be created.

~> To create a Policy Assignment at a Management Group use the `azurerm_management_group_policy_assignment` resource, for a Resource Group use the `azurerm_resource_group_policy_assignment` and for a Subscription use the `azurerm_subscription_policy_assignment` resource.

terraform import azurerm_resource_policy_assignment.example "{resource}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/assignment1"
```

where `{resource}` is a Resource ID in the form `/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/network1`.
