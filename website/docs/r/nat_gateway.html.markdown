# azurerm_nat_gateway

Manages a Azure NAT Gateway.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "nat-gateway-example-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_public_ip" "example" {
  name                = "nat-gateway-publicIP"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  allocation_method   = "Static"
  sku                 = "Standard"
  zones               = ["1"]
}

resource "azurerm_public_ip_prefix" "example" {
  name                = "nat-gateway-publicIPPrefix"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  prefix_length       = 30
  zones               = ["1"]
}

resource "azurerm_nat_gateway" "example" {
  name                    = "nat-Gateway"
  location                = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name     = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  public_ip_address_ids   = [azurerm_public_ip.example.id]
  public_ip_prefix_ids    = [azurerm_public_ip_prefix.example.id]
  sku_name                = "Standard"
  idle_timeout_in_minutes = 10
  zones                   = ["1"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the NAT Gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Resource Group in which the NAT Gateway should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Optional) Specifies the supported Azure location where the NAT Gateway should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `idle_timeout_in_minutes` - (Optional) The idle timeout which should be used in minutes. Defaults to `4`.

* `public_ip_address_ids` - (Optional / **Deprecated in favour of `azurerm_nat_gateway_public_ip_association`**) A list of Public IP Address ID's which should be associated with the NAT Gateway resource.

* `public_ip_prefix_ids` - (Optional) / **Deprecated in favour of `azurerm_nat_gateway_public_ip_prefix_association`**) A list of Public IP Prefix ID's which should be associated with the NAT Gateway resource.

* `sku_name` - (Optional) The SKU which should be used. At this time the only supported value is `Standard`. Defaults to `Standard`.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `zones` - (Optional) Specifies a list of Availability Zones in which this NAT Gateway should be located. Changing this forces a new NAT Gateway to be created.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the NAT Gateway.

* `resource_guid` - The resource GUID property of the NAT Gateway.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 60 minutes) Used when creating the NAT Gateway.
* `update` - (Defaults to 60 minutes) Used when updating the NAT Gateway.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the NAT Gateway.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 60 minutes) Used when deleting the NAT Gateway.

## Import

NAT Gateway can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_nat_gateway.test /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/gateway1
```
